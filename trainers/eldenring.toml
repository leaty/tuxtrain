# NOTICE: DO NOT RUN THIS WITH EAC ENABLED.
#
# TuxTrain is generic and it doesn't care what you are doing, therefor
# it does NOT care about something like EAC. I've not yet heard anyone
# neither try nor getting banned for unlocking their FPS, but I don't
# think you want to be the first either. It is also unfair when others
# are forced to play at 60 FPS.
#
# The regions in this trainer are fully tightened, I am not entirely sure
# if they are the same for different versions/releases of Elden Ring.
#
# If tuxtrain cannot find the pattern, please create an issue!
# See below for how to find the correct region for your version:
#
#	- Either remove the region entirely to search the entire process
#	memory (this may take some time), tuxtrain will then output the
#	correct region once found.
#
#	- Or manually try each map (based on /proc/pid/maps), they should
#	look similar to below. Convert the addresses to decimal
#	(e.g. 140000000-140001000 for [start, end]), it's likely the ones close
#	in number to the preset regions in this file.
